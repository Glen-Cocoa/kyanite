## Philosophy

The goal for Kyanite is to be stripped down, light weight, and intuitive. The idea is to be performant and easy to use in a functional setting, making it simple to build reusable functions in your code base with powerful and organized algorithmic pipes. Ultimately, Kyaniteâ€™s continued growth and improvement will support the growth and improvement of the JavaScript community

## Key Features

- Purely Functional - This was a main focus for the project. I wanted it to be an easy to use, functional system while also being completely pure by making use of piping and transducers to boost performance.
- Single type utility functions - Theoretically, all of the functionality is based around accepting a single data type, doing what it does, and giving you back a result, thus making it reliable, stable, and lightweight.
- Everything is curried! Setup static in one spot and then pass the rest of the dynamic data in later.
- Data last ideaology

## How To

With a CDN

```html
<!-- It is recommended to replace the @latest with a strict version number for production -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/kyanite@latest/dist/kyanite.min.js"></script>
<!-- To use the debug friendly kyanite simply remove .min from the filename -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/kyanite@latest/dist/kyanite.js"></script>
<script>
  const K = kyanite

  K.isEmpty({})
</script>
```

Or installing with `npm i kyanite` and then:

Standard module system

```js
// This will use the module path in the package.json (src/index.js)
import K from 'kyanite'
// However if you want to grab the dev version
import K from 'kyanite/dist/kyanite.js'
```

Common JS

```js
// For the prod minified version
const K = require('kyanite')
// For the dev/debug friendly version
const K = require('kyanite/dist/kyanite.js')
```

Local copy script tag

```html
<!-- To use the prod minified version -->
<script src="/path/to/dist/kyanite.min.js"></script>
<!-- To use the dev/debug friendly version -->
<script src="/path/to/dist/kyanite.js"></script>
<script>
  const K = kyanite

  K.isEmpty({})
</script>
```

## Credit

A lot of the if not most of the inpiration for this library came from 2 libraries I follow closely, Primarily most of it stems from:

- [foreword](https://github.com/abstract-tools/foreword) by [Abstract Tools](https://github.com/abstract-tools) which is a very nice and easy to use library developed by a close friend. This is where a lot of functionality, AND the idea of a pure single data type system came from I can't recommend it enough.
- [Ramdajs](http://ramdajs.com/) by [Ramda](https://github.com/ramda) a large and fairly handy library where the original idea sparked
